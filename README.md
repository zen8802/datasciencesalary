Exploratory data analysis done on Data Science 2023 Dataset from Kaggle.

The Data Science 2023 Dataset is obviously a rather relevant dataset for me, a student in Statistical Data Science nearing graduation. I wanted to learn about what salaries to expect, and what distinctions there where in the jobs titles. Furthermore, it provides me a perspective as to what I can expect from the future. There are several key factors to the wage of a job that I've never considered deeply together previously, such experience level, employment type, company size, and geographical location.
